## Architecture

> Laravel 12 with Eloquent ORM for database operations using PostgreSQL 17 database.
>
> RESTful routes with Controllers and Form Requests for validation.
>
> Resourceful structure, with clear separation of concerns.
>
> JWT for stateless authentication.
>
> Swagger annotations for comprehensive API documentation.

## Data Structure

-   **User**: handles authentication and task ownership.

-   **Task**: associated with a user and optionally a category.

-   **Category**: seeded data, linked directly to tasks.

## Design Decisions

> Categories: seeded in the database, simple fixed dataset, no need for dynamic creation or optimization.
>
> Query optimization: not applied due to simplicity and small dataset size, standard Eloquent queries used.
>
> Validation: handled via Laravelâ€™s built-in validation system through Form Requests.

## Features

-   User registration, login, logout, and update.

-   CRUD operations for tasks.

-   Filter tasks by category ID or search by title/description.

-   API fully documented with Swagger.

## Notes

-   No asset compilation required for the backend.

-   Code adheres to Laravel conventions with clean organization and structure.
